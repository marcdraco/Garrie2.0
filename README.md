This very simple, dual layer board provides power rails for 0 and split supples (or at your option) a single supply and and output bus.

They work out at about 70p per board (85c?) at the current price whch isn't bad and that's for a run of 10 from JLC. Other board houses might be more expensive of course.

Supplied are allt he KiCAD project files you need - you can prepare the Gerbers yourself but KiCAD has extensions for several popular board houses which simplifies this process enormously.
